09-11-2023,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Subject : Complaint Against Chase Business Account Claim Department in Texas Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a complaint against the Chase Business Account Claim Department located in Texas. Since the beginning of this year, they have been engaging in questionable practices that have greatly affected my business operations. 

My company officially started its commercial activities earlier this year and set up a website, requiring the purchase of various internet-related services. Suddenly, several domestic service providers in the United States, including the Chase Claim Department, seemed to have colluded against me. In the end, I had to set up the website 's server to a company in XXXX to run it normally. They either refused to provide services or, when they did, the services were all open source and were immediately canceled by me. However, they immediately joined forces to siphon funds from my account. This includes clear evidence in the form of emails and receipts showing payments made to the other party. My company has not received a single cent in its Chase account, and they transferred the funds directly to the companies providing the canceled services. 

From that moment on, Chase 's Business Account stopped depositing any payments to my account, and they have been withholding refunds and payments I have made for over a year. Additionally, this Department has colluded with other businesses to steal money from my account. I have provided evidence showing that these businesses did not provide any services, and their services were supposed to be free for 30 days. I only tried their services for a couple of hours and canceled within that timeframe. However, there have been multiple instances where they took my money and refused to refund it. It appears that they are returning the funds to the service providers, and I have been unable to recover these amounts. 

The main reason for these issues is that at the beginning of the year, I started various commercial activities, and I may need to try out new projects. Therefore, I experimented with several businesses, but Chase 's account handling department kept returning my money to the service providers and refused to help me recover it. They seemed to be aiding these businesses in stealing money from my account. This eventually led me to change the server settings for my website to ensure normal operations. 

I kindly request that the CFPB investigate these practices by the Chase Business Account Claim Department in Texas and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. I believe that their actions are unethical and detrimental to my business operations. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

09-10-2023,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"This company has violated my consumer rights and has defamed my character by attempting to collect an alleged debt and reporting it to consumer reporting agencies. I have never engaged in an agreement with this company, nor have I given them written authorization to report this information to any consumer reporting agency. Furthermore, they are communicating with me both directly and indirectly to attempt to collect an alleged debt which violates FDCPA laws. To be more specific, 15 USC 1692f ( 1 ) and 15 USC 1692c. I have a right to privacy pursuant to the privacy act of 1974 and this company did not get my permission to use my social security number causing me massive damages.

09-10-2023,Debt collection,Auto debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Seized or attempted to seize your property,"Hyundai Capital America received a negotiable instrument number XXXX to pay off the above-referenced account. On or before XX/XX/XXXX Hyundai Capital America endorsed the Negotiable Instrument and credited my account. I received correspondence from Hyundai Capital America confirming that the Instrument was accepted, and the account was paid in full. However, on or before XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that the negotiable instrument had been dishonored and my account had been reversed. I never received notification of the reversal and the negotiable instrument was never returned with a written explanation of why it was an unacceptable form of payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from an Agent at Hyundai Capital America asking me to give them back the title to the car. I repeatedly explained that I never received a title in the mail. ( Unaware that vehicle titles no longer get mailed but are now done electronically and must be picked up at state title agency ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I woke up around XXXX XXXX in the morning to go get my heating pad out of the car because I was in so much pain after my recent XXXX XXXXXXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, only to walk out of my house to find that my car had been stolen. 

The following day, I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to report my car stolen only to be informed that Hyundai Capital America had enlisted or hired XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to seize my vehicle. The theft of my vehicle was unjustified because I was not in default on my loan agreement. 

I want to bring your attention to the first line of Hyundai 's Arbitration Clause which states EITHER YOU OR WE MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US DECIDED BY ARBITRATION The arbitration clause further states that Neither you nor we waive the right to arbitrate by using self-help remedies, such as repossession, or by filing an action to recover the Vehicle, to recover a deficiency balance, or for individual injunctive relief. 

If Hyundai Capital America had any grievance with me with regard to the terms of the agreement or the negotiable instrument that was presented for tender of payment, then Hyundai Capital America should have upheld the terms of the agreement and disputed the allegations through the arbitration process. 

Instead, Hyundai Capital America chose to willfully violate the law and the agreement by using self-help remedies and malicious behavior, such as the theft of my vehicle, threatening to file a civil action against me, reporting inaccurate information to all 3 credit bureaus, and using intimidation tactics to recover a deficiency balance that was caused by a clerical error from Hyundai Capital America . 

I later discovered that Hyundai Capital America 's actions were intentional because Hyundai Capital America was not legally competent to process a negotiable instrument. Ignorance of the Law is not an excuse to hold me legally responsible for Hyundai Capital Americas clerical errors. Hyundai Capital America used the language check when a conspicuous statement of sufficient type size was clearly readable and placed on the negotiable instrument which states, This MUST be Processed/Deposited as a Negotiable Instrument. It was expected that the negotiable instrument be thoroughly examined by Hyundai Motor Finance. 

The following are the violations that Hyundai Capital America committed against me 1. ) Hyundai Capital America has violated the Uniform Commercial Code by dishonoring my negotiable instrument/note presented for tender of payment. Florida Statute 673.5021, 673.5031, and 673.505. The holder of the instrument must issue a notice of dishonor before midnight of the next banking day within 30 days. The negotiable instrument was sent to Hyundai Capital America in XXXX, and my account was credited and reflected a XXXX balance. In XXXX, Hyundai Capital America reversed the charges and dishonored the negotiable instrument. Until this day, I have not received correspondence from Hyundai Capital America informing me of a dishonored instrument. 

2. ) Violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) by closing my account and reporting the final balance as a charge-off. A charge-off means a company has written off a debt which typically follows 180 days or six months of nonpayment, and the company believes it will not receive the money that its owed. This is usually when the account has reached default and a repossession takes place, however ; this was not the issue in my case. Although I submitted the negotiable instrument in good faith, I never stopped making my monthly payments to my account. Even the last correspondence from Hyundai Capital America to me dated XX/XX/XXXX, states Your account is also currently 0 days PAST DUE IN THE AMOUNT OF {$0.00}. Making Hyundai Capital America 's actions unlawful and not considered a repossession but an act of grand theft. Hyundai Capital America violated Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) Sections 623 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( E ) and 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( E ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

3. ) Hyundai Capital America failed to follow the proper procedures for repossession and sale of my vehicle, which resulted in wrongful repossession. According to Section 493.6404 ( 2 ) ( d ) ( e ), f.s. Five ( 5 ) working days after the repossession I was supposed to receive a written notice of the location of my personal items and the procedures for reclaiming them. I never received a notification from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was supposed to provide me with a disposal notice and give me an opportunity to collect my personal items. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX disposed of my items without sending me a written notification by the United States Postal Service. Lastly, I made an appointment to pick up my personal items on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Only to find out that XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX towed my car to an undisclosed location on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX intention was not to allow me to pick up my personal belongings. According to Section 493.6118 ( 1 ) ( f ), f.s is a form of deceit. I have a recording of a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stating the car had already left and that I would need to contact the bank to retrieve the rest of my personal items. 

4. ) Defamation of Character : Hyundai Capital America reported inaccurate information to all three ( 3 ) credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) which has reduced my credit score and decreased my buying power. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 2 ) Sections 623 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( E ) and 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( E ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ). 

5. ) Breach of Arbitration Agreement : The arbitration agreement applies to both parties, not just to the consumer.

09/14/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"Preface : The matters outlined herein delve into the multifaceted intricacies of financial transactions and roles. For a holistic understanding and apt resolution, we recommend that this complaint be scrutinized by personnel possessing a deep-seated knowledge of financial nuances. 

I. Issue 1 : Mischaracterization of Roles. 

Description : PayPal has inadvertently conflated the roles, erroneously designating the complainant as the principal debtor when they are in fact a third-party surety. This error breeds confusion concerning the distribution of responsibilities between PayPal and the genuine obligor. 

II. Issue 2 : Ambiguity Surrounding Financial Instruments. 

Description : While the mainstream perception is that entities like PayPal proffer credit to be repaid subsequently, in a specie-devoid economy, a plethora of negotiable instruments exemplified by securities like T-bills, commercial paper, money orders, CDs, drafts, cheques, and bank drafts can be liquidated. Although this practice might align with current regulations, its underlying intricacies have been obscured, potentially leading to misinterpretations.

III. Issue 3 : Nuances of Security Interest and Subrogation Rights.

Description : PayPal retains a security interest as per the agreement. Ideally, this interest should actuate the settlement of the principal debtor 's obligations through assets, notably securities, from the debtor 's estate. Moreover, the right of subrogation, which may allow the third-party surety to substitute certain rights in lieu of PayPal after addressing the debtor 's commitment, remains ambiguously defined. This pervasive security interest, active irrespective of a default, suggests unforeseen implications for the surety, particularly concerning potential subrogation rights.

IV. Issue 4 : Comprehensive Transparency in Investment Reporting.

Description : While PayPal engages with a myriad of financial instruments, its disclosures during stakeholder meetings seem to lack granularity, prompting a more in-depth review. 

Note on Prior Communication : Engagements have been initiated with PayPal 's legal department about specific unfavorable conditions in the contract, especially the clause conferring them a security interest. Though a direct alteration to the contract was deemed infeasible by PayPal, an appeal for a mutual equitable arrangement was proffered by the complainant. A conclusive response to this proposition remains outstanding.",None,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",WI,XXXXX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,09/14/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7550650

I was eventually issued the physical card they originally failed to deliver, so that I could access the account, review statements, and pay the balance.

09/13/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against Chase Bank regarding their failure to provide the promised bonus offer upon meeting the requirements for the Chase Freedom Credit Card. I believe that Chase has engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by not fulfilling the offer stated on their official website during my application process. 

On or around XX/XX/2023, I applied for a Chase Freedom Credit Card through the official Chase website. The website clearly displayed the New Card Member Offer, stating that I would earn a {$200.00} bonus after spending {$500.00} within the first XXXX months of opening the account. The offer was a significant incentive for me to choose Chase as my credit card provider, and I proceeded with the application based on this offer. 

After diligently using the Chase Freedom Credit Card and spending well over the required {$500.00} within the specified timeframe, I noticed that the promised bonus was not credited to my account. Concerned about the discrepancy, I promptly contacted Chase 's customer service department via email to inquire about the missing bonus. 

To my surprise, the response from Chase 's customer service team was highly unsatisfactory. They claimed that the offer I mentioned was not included in the offers associated with my card. However, I applied for the credit card through the official Chase website, where the {$200.00} bonus offer was prominently displayed. It is perplexing and misleading that Chase would advertise an offer on their website and then deny its existence when customers meet the stated requirements. 

Despite my attempts to seek clarification and a clear explanation as to why I was deemed ineligible for the bonus, Chase failed to provide a satisfactory response. Instead, they closed the inquiry without addressing my concerns adequately. As a new customer who followed the prescribed application process and relied on the information provided by Chase, I believe that their conduct is unfair, deceptive, and in violation of consumer protection regulations. 

In light of the aforementioned circumstances, I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter thoroughly. I urge Chase to rectify the situation by honoring the promised bonus offer and providing a clear explanation for their misleading advertising practices. Additionally, I request that appropriate action be taken against Chase to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and to ensure fair treatment of all consumers. 

Enclosed with this complaint, please find relevant documentation, including screenshots of the Chase website displaying the bonus offer, as well as copies of email correspondence with Chase 's customer service department. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take appropriate action to address this issue and protect consumer rights. I look forward to a prompt resolution and a satisfactory outcome.

09-11-2023,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I am a former citi XXXX. My XXXX XXXX is XXXX Ive worked at the XXXX for a little less than 3 years and during my last week of employment on XX/XX/XXXX, exactly {$8500.00} was stolen from my account. 
$ XXXX in the form of a wire transfer {$25.00} for the fee And 3 ACH transactions totaling {$1400.00}. 

I was working in the XXXX the day that it happened and the only reason I even found out was because it was pay day and I usually tend to move money around and pay bills. I immediately ran to my manager and called the employee service line in order to have them block all my accounts and block all further transactions as well as try to recover the funds. The representative was able to block the accounts to prevent any further debit transactions and we filed a dispute or so I thought. I filled out an affidavit to attest that I had nothing to do with the stolen funds and that I gain nothing from the stolen funds. 
All the necessary documents were uploaded and I was instructed to call another number in order to talk to a different department who was in charge of wire fraud and they would process a different dispute on their end. 

Citi banks customer service, weather it be for a customer or an employee is absolutely horrendous and they will have you waiting on hold for close to 30 min in order to get outsourced to the XXXX for a level 1 agent. I have nothing against the call centers or representatives in the XXXX but it is very common for calls to drop and there is often miscommunication between the 2 parties. 

After finally getting ahold of someone who was able to put my fraud case in, the only thing left to do was wait. The representative told me the investigation would take up to 60 days in order to get any of the funds back. 

I was also told that I would have to wait on a phone call from the investigator handling my case in order to move forward. 
At this point Im basically at the mercy of the investigator and nothing happens for weeks. I call every week in order to get updates only to get the run around and for each representative to tell me to keep waiting and that as long as I had the affidavit signed and uploaded, everything should be okay. 

Eventually the investigator calls many weeks later and pretty much interrogates me to see if I was somehow involved As a former XXXX I saw people coming in because they were scammed every single day and it was basically programmed into me not to click on any links or pick up any random phone calls. 

I kept telling the investigator that I had nothing to do with it and that I just want my funds returned to me but she kept insisting on whether or not I clicked a link or answered a text or call, ( which I did not do ). And the reason they keep insisting is because Citi believes that the second you say yes to any of those questions, you are liable for the losses. 
After the call was over I got no updates whatsoever and would continue to call citi begging for some sort of answer or resolution but the representatives would tell me that I needed to wait the 60 days to get an answer and I did. On the 60 th day I called and to no ones surprise, I needed to keep waiting because they still didnt have an answer. 
On the 64 th day I was finally able to get my answer and Citi denied my claim for failure to safeguard my account and because they thought I was a victim of a scam. 

After 64 days of losing all the money I had to my name, the XXXX that I started my career with and XXXX nearly 3 years for, the XXXX that my parents started with and have had for 35 years since they immigrated to America, the XXXX that I was once so proud to call my own denied me and told me there was nothing they could do. 

And just to clarify in case you were wondering, I wasnt fired or let go either, I had resigned in order to move forward with a greater opportunity with more potential and after this experience it has been the best decision of my life. 

After sending an email I received a phone call from the executive fraud department of citi telling me to rest assured and that they would re open the investigation and that they would be in contact with me to further review my case. 

When in fact the only thing they did after wards was assign it to another investigator who asked me the same set of questions as the previous investigator attempting to get me to falsely agree that this was a scam and I was the one to be blamed. 

A couple of weeks later I called in again for an update and found out that I was rejected again for the same reason as before and that I was to blame.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,11572,None,Consent provided,Web,09-11-2023,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7532536

I have been told this check will be on hold for 3 years and no funds will be available. both me and my husband have made at least 5 calls to PNC to find out why and how this is possible, my husband XXXX XXXX has assisted me on several of the calls. We get the same results from the representatives about this matter. They will call me back. They dont, this is disingenuous and not in good faith from PNC . Im curious how can you get away with holding this for three years? All we get from the PNC representatives is that's it on hold. never a reason. but they will have to get with the investigator to find out why? in fairness we did receive two calls, one from XXXX and the other from XXXX. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, my husband called the following number and spoke with XXXX, his phone number is XXXX. XXXX said he's trying to get in touch with the investigator and find out why this check has been placed on hold for three years. OK this is past acceptable for me and my family to give PNC my money for 3 years.

.

During these conversations all of which should all be recorded at held by PNC Bank for further evidence. I get the tone as well as an underlying issue that due to my origin, being XXXX  and me relocating to the state, PNC is issuing some discriminatory practice on me, i get the feeling that i am being red flags for all my deposits because I XXXX. 

It is completely unfair and unfathomable that PNC continues this practice of holding my check for {$1100.00}, Why? the account the check was written on has already been debited, certainly your organization would have and can call XXXX and XXXX XXXX to verify at any given time. Why are you keeping my funds for 25 days? And give me no reasoning nor justification on why you wont disburse the funds into my account. This has caused a huge inconvenience for my livelihood as well as all the stress and strain of this ordeal has been very disturbing. 

Moving forward I will not bank with PNC ever again ; discrimination and communicative issues are so stressful ; your organization is so XXXX and hard for folks that want their hard-earned money in their account but instead it is place on a 3-year hold.

Make no mistake, I'm closing this account and believe I should not be charged any service fee since PNC has refused my deposit. I want to close my account and stay as far away from you as possible. its painfully obvious that being XXXX you have discriminatory behavior to our country. Why does PNC keep my money and refuses to deposit my money into my account? only PNC can answer that, Im disappointed in your bank, i just want what is mine and I want it immediately I'm tired of waiting for my money.

( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.

( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

( b ) Reasonable procedures It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.

The response is dated XX/XX/XXXX and appears to be a response to a complaint I filed with the Florida Attorney General, although that is not stated in their response. 
The response from Mr. Cooper does not mention the Second and Final Notice to obtain hazard insurance or they ( RightPath Servicing ) will purchase hazard insurance on my behalf. I specifically mentioned this notice I received on XX/XX/XXXX from RightPath Servicing, in my complaint to the Attorney General, therefore, I can only assume this response is regarding my complaint even though there is no mention or explanation for RightPath sending this second and final notice, as requested by the Florida Attorney General. 
Mr. Cooper cunningly omits information regarding the Second and Final Notice sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX because this is the basis of my complaint and is also definitive proof of deception by RightPath Servicing. 
RightPath Servicing clearly stated Hazard insurance was needed on my property and goes on to describe this hazard insurance, that being, it would only cover the structure, such as the roof, of my property. I provided RightPath Servicing proof, multiple times, of having this hazard insurance coverage, as they described, through my HOA master policy. 
In XX/XX/XXXX RightPath Servicing charged me for HO6 insurance and not hazard insurance as described in this Second and Final Notice. My mortgage payment was increased by {$1000.00} per month. 
There is no mistaking what HO6 insurance coverage is and it surely isnt what was described as Hazard insurance in their notice dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
This deliberately deceptive practice can cause many, like myself, to be threatened with foreclosure if they do not pay into this fraudulent scheme. Mr. Cooper is now refusing to accept my mortgage payments, after I did not sign the loan modification they sent me, a modification I did not request. I was, conveniently, pre approved for this loan modification I did not request or apply for. 
I understand, per their response, that Mr. Cooper is now in the process of foreclosing on my property. I have sent RightPath Servicing monthly mortgage payment that they have refused to apply to my loan.

RightPath Servicing/Mr. Cooper has clearly violated the FDUTPA, The Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act with their deceptive practice, as stated above, and must be investigated. It is very likely, given the troubling history of Mr. Cooper, that a class-action law suit may be necessary.

09/14/23,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Preface : This complaint addresses significant ambiguities in financial transactions and roles with American Express. Expert review is advised for accurate resolution. 

I. Role Mischaracterization : American Express has blended the roles of the complainant ( surety ) and the principal debtor. This misidentification not only confuses responsibilities but inadvertently shifts principal debtor liabilities onto the surety. 

II. Financial Instruments as Securities : Various negotiable instruments function as securities with intrinsic value. These securities, connected to the principal debtor 's estate, should be the primary mode to offset liabilities. The current lack of clarity burdens the surety unnecessarily. 

III. Security Interest Ambiguity : American Express 's security interest implies asset collateralization. When not clear, it unfairly burdens the surety, especially when the debtor 's estate securities could be used for obligation settlement.",None,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,WI,XXXXX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,09/14/23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7550387

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( not PennyMac ). This made me call PennyMac. They demanded an over-the-phone payment and threated debt collector again, so I made my second mortgage payment for the month of XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, five days after permitting an e-payment, I made my XXXX mortgage payment. THEN, on XXXX, they CASHED the check I mailed on XX/XX/XXXX. Now they have been paid twice for XXXX, AND I have sent payment for XXXX ... which they could receive and cash very shortly. So I called PennyMac again. I spoke with an agent AT LENGTH, and they finally acquiesced to return my money. I requested that this be returned electronically so funds would be immediately available, especially since my XXXX mortgage check could be cashed at any moment. I was told that he "" expedited '' the fund reimbursement and that I should have my money within 3-5 business days. 
On XXXX I call to follow up as I have not received an e-bursement, and I don't trust them. At this LONG call... .I finally get a supervisor, and discover that they MAILED a physical check that should be there in a few days. This is unacceptable, I need my money back before my other bills are due and they inevitably cash my XXXX check. Then I'm told that NOW I will have an e-bursement to my account in 24-48 hours, that they cancelled the physical check, and the same supervisor says he will call in 48 hours to verify that I have my money.

They canceled and blocked my card immediately. Then they sent me a new card and told me that they would be looking into it and that I needed to give them 45 days to do so. They did not provide me with a provisional credit for that amount in the meantime nor did they ever try to do a chargeback to the merchant. So I contacted the merchant and the merchant try to issue a refund but it kept declining the refund. They have been trying to do a refund but money Network since XX/XX/2023 but money Network a division of Fiserv has been declining to accept the money that the merchant is trying to return. They said that they will be mailing me some papers to fill out that I needed to return I filled them out and faxed them over. I called several days later was told that the fax was received and someone was looking into it only to later be told that they never received my paperwork. My paperwork was faxed to them on XX/XX/2023. Since XX/XX/XXXX they have continually denied my claim. They keep insisting that the merchant is trying to charge me additional charges for the same amount and has done so or attempted to do so approximately the last 7 months sometimes over five times in a month but when I contact the merchant the merchant is telling me they are trying to issue the refund but the bank has put a block on the merchant so that they are unable to do so. They never contacted the merchant never gave me a provisional credit haven't closed this issue for me and refuse to resolve it and now they're telling me that I have to contact the merchant and have the merchant write me a letter with a signature on it that says that they want to return the money to me. This is not my job this is their job. I have appealed and they continue to deny my appeal saying that I need to provide them with a letter from the merchant that says that he wants to return my money despite the fact that the merchant has already attempted to issue me a refund over nine times but because they put some kind of block on the card that was used he is unable to do so. This has been ongoing since XX/XX/2023 and it is currently XX/XX/2023. Now I've been informed that they can't do a chargeback anymore because they can only do a chargeback for 120 days and this issue continues to go on. Nobody there seems to know what's going on nobody knows what their job is. They have never investigated they have never reached out to the merchant they literally have just continually deny my claim. I find myself calling them every single week asking them for an update and the only thing that they're telling me right now is unless the merchant writes me a letter that says that I deserve to have my money back that they're not going to do anything which is no different than what they've already done because they seriously haven't done anything. According to the law they were supposed to investigate the issue and provide me with a provisional credit for the amount that was fraudulently charged to my account. And I was supposed to be given access to the funds if they were to investigate it for 45 days. Which is the time limit I was given when I reported the charges. Or they were supposed to have this case closed within 10 days. Neither one of those things have been done. I have not received my credit and it's going on 7 or 8 months now that I'm fighting with this company trying to get my money back and they literally will do nothing. I don't know who else to contact this is seriously out of hand. I've never ever had to deal with a bank like this before where I was charged fraudulent charges. It's like they seriously want me to do their job for them I have to reach out to the merchant to ask them to return my money or give the bank ideas on how to get my money back. I know it may not seem like a big deal to them it's only {$240.00} for me right now that's a lot of money and I have kids to feed and I am frankly tired of waiting and someone needs to fix that. I have also attempted to file several complaints to their company but like I said no one has reached out to me no one has given me an explanation as to why they're denying my claim no one has told me anything all I've been told is that it is not their job to contact the merchant to ask him to do a refund apparently that's my job to provide them with proof that the merchant wants to return the money to me I don't understand it so I'm running to you hoping that maybe you can help me deal with this company because seriously I have no idea what to do anymore this is literally causing me unnecessary stress.,None,FISERV INC.,VA,242XX,None,Consent provided,Web,09/21/23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7587465

I have used my card several times over the past 6 years and have always made on time payments, never had a late payment. I used the lock feature on their mobile app to prevent anyone from stealing my card number and making charges. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification from XXXX that my acceptance with Barclay 's had been closed dropping my credit score by XXXX points ( due to Barclay 's performing an unauthorized credit check for an unexplained reason ). I have never had a single late payment on ANY of my credit cards. Why Barclay 's chose to check my credit without obtaining my authorization is beyond me. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to ask. I was not provided an answer and was told that I had been mauled a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, the same day that the account was closed. I received the letter just today and it mentions that the credit decision was based on inactivity in the past 3 months ( no information about this in any correspondence to me ever ) and high usage on one or more accounts on my credit report. It goes on to say that the consumer agency that provided information that influenced their decision was XXXX ( which also included my current score of XXXX which isn't much different than the score of XXXX XXXX years ago used in approving my account ). Then the letter turns around and makes a contradiction in that the "" reporting agency played no part in their decision and is unable to supply specific reasons why Barclay 's has taken this action ''.

The reason that I believe Barclay 's has made this bad faith decision is because part of my income derives from a public assistance program, namely SSDI. The company has also recently asked my marital status which I found odd.

Upon learning of this unfortunate and discriminatory closure of my account, I immediately called Barclay 's and asked for a clarification on their decision to which I was told that I would receive a letter in the mail. I offered to make an immediate purchase to have the account reopened ( since I wasn't informed that a purchase within 3 months was a requirement ) and was told no and that they would not reopen my account but that I could apply for a new account ( which of course would have a much lower credit score because of a direct result of their decision to close my account ).

I request that you take immediate action to delete these items from my consumer report in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

As a diligent consumer, I have thoroughly reviewed my consumer report and discovered the presence of inquiries that have been reported without my written consent, thereby contravening the provisions outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This violation is not only a breach of my privacy rights but also undermines the fundamental protections guaranteed to consumers under the U.S. Constitution.

Moreover, in accordance with the "" saving to suitors '' clause as prescribed in sections 41 ( 3 ) and 371 ( 3 ) of title 28, U.S.C., I am asserting my rights to seek resolution of this matter through appropriate channels. The fraudulent reporting of these inquiries is in direct violation of the principles enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, which upholds the sanctity of individual rights and protections.

I kindly request that you promptly investigate this matter and initiate the necessary steps to delete these unauthorized inquiries from my consumer report. It is crucial that your agency takes immediate action to rectify this error, as the presence of these inquiries is not only inaccurate but also has the potential to impact my creditworthiness and financial well-being. 

Please find my information below for reference : Name : XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX Email Address : XXXX I expect your full cooperation in resolving this matter expeditiously, within the prescribed timeframes as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Failure to comply with these legal obligations may leave me with no choice but to pursue further action to protect my rights as a consumer.

I would appreciate a written confirmation acknowledging receipt of this dispute letter and providing an outline of the actions you intend to take to address this matter. Furthermore, I request that you provide me with a copy of my updated consumer report once the unauthorized inquiries have been removed.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will handle this dispute with the utmost diligence and professionalism, adhering to the legal guidelines and your responsibilities as a consumer reporting agency.
